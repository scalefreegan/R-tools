plotCI <- function(data,upperCI,lowerCI=NULL,col=NULL) {
  # Function plots data with confidence bounds using polygons
  # Useful for visualizing trends in groups of data without the
  # noise of many lines
  # data is a vector or list of data to be plotted
  # upperCI is a vector or list of distances to be plotted 
  # upward from data
  # same goes for lowerCI, but this is plotted on bottom
  # lengths of data, upperCI, lowerCI should correspond
